Introduction

\section{Data}
We used \emph{\href{https://data.cityofnewyork.us/view/ba8s-jw6u}{2015 Yellow Taxi Trip Data}}. We fetched them using \emph{\href{https://dev.socrata.com}{Socrata library}}.

\subsection{Preprocessing}
Provided data needed a little bit of preprocessing to fit our needs and also to get rid of corrupted rows and unneeded columns. \\
Firstly, data fetched using Socrata library were missing information about data types or all columns had string data type, so we converted them to right data type. \\
Then, we removed all rows with dropoff/pickup latitude outside of range \(\left[38, 43\right]\) and dropoff/pickup longitude outside of range \(\left[-76, -72\right]\). There were some rows with latitude/longitude $0$, probably because of gps turned off or not working. Also, there were some rows with latitude/longitude outside of New York, which we don't want to deal with. \\
Then, we converted \emph{pickup\_datetime} and \emph{dropoff\_datetime} columns, which contain datetime timestamp string to python datetime object. For it, we used \emph{weekday()} method to get weekday and \emph{time().hour()} methods to get hour of the day. We add those as 4 new columns (pickup\_weekday, pickup\_hour, dropoff\_weekday, dropoff\_hour). \\
Finally, we dropped unneeded columns.
